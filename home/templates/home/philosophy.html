    <h1 class="page-header">Our Teaching Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Our teaching philosophy entails instilling a complete, comprehensive understanding of our curriculum and of all the examinable topics students may face in each test. We appreciate that each studentâ€™s needs  are unique and therefore, our learning and revision packs will be tailored to the performance of each individual. These packs facilitate greater development of the areas in which the student has performed less highly, providing a greater foundation of understanding. We have found that the performance of students in the 11+ examinations, particularly in selective eligibility exams, dramatically improve when students have a more thorough understanding of the topics that they will be examined on. Classes on operating under timed conditions, common errors and exam structure will also feature in the curriculum, culminating in mock exams during the final few weeks.  At Only 11+, we strive to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of each student, complementing their small group tuition with individual exercises to ensure exceptional exam performance. We aim to equip students with the understanding to answer any given exam question to the highest degree.</p>
