        <p>Just11Plus provide tuition classes, running on a weekly basis for children having entered Year 4 or 5, expecting to undertake their 11 plus exam in 2018 or 2019. Our weekly lessons are 2 hours in length (1 hour for Maths and 1 hour for English), during which we will teach our carefully constructed syllabus and monitor their development. We provide homework, drawing upon and reinforcing the content and techniques that have been taught in the lesson prior.
